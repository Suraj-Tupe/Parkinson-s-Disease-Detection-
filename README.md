# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-
Abstract  Parkinson’s disease is caused by the disruption of the brain cells that produce substance to allow brain cells to communicate with each other, called dopamine. The cells that produce dopamine in the brain are responsible for the control, adaptation and fluency of movements. When 60–80%of these cells are lost, then enough dopamine is not produced and Parkinson’s motor symptoms appear. It is thought that the disease begins many years before the motor (movement related) symptoms and therefore, researchers are looking for ways to recognize the non-motor symptoms that appear early in the disease as early as possible, thereby halting the progression of the disease.In this Project ,  machine learning based diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is presented. The proposed diagnosis method consists of feature selection and classification processes. Feature Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination methods were considered for feature selection task. Classification and Regression Trees and Support Vector Machines were used for the classification of Parkinson's patients in the experiments.
